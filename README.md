  ## Experience

  Here is a summary of my current and previous job roles (with a few more details than my resume).

  ### :office: (Feb. 2020 - today) Researcher (Software Developer) at [TII](https://www.tii.ae/), Abu Dhabi&nbsp; <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Flag_of_the_United_Arab_Emirates.svg/180px-Flag_of_the_United_Arab_Emirates.svg.png" width="30">

  I am one of the core developers of the open source quantum computing Python framework [Qibo](https://github.com/qiboteam/qibo).
  
  We started developing a high-performance state vector quantum circuit simulation for different classical hardware platforms (multi-threading CPU, GPU, multi-GPU) using [TensoFlow custom operators](https://github.com/qiboteam/qibotf).
  Performance benchmarks and an overview of the library's features were [published in the Quantum Science and Technology journal](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/ac39f5).
  Later we re-implemented similar operators using the [just-in-time compilation](https://github.com/qiboteam/qibojit) features of [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) and [cupy](https://cupy.dev/).
  Benchmarks of this new approach were [published in the Quantum journal](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2022-09-22-814/).

  Later, we started developing [Qibolab](https://github.com/qiboteam/qibolab) a backend for deploying circuits on self-hosted quantum hardware (mainly superconducting quantum chips) and 
  [Qibocal](https://github.com/qiboteam/qibocal) a tool for easy deployment and reporting of calibration and characterization experiments.
  This suite was used to compare various commercial electronics and FPGA boards used for qubit control, leading to another [publication in Quantum](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2024-02-12-1247/).

  ### :office: (March 2019 - June 2019) Quantum Resident at [(Alphabet) X](https://x.company/), Mountain View, CA&nbsp; <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/180px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png" width="30">

  I was the first Quantum Resident in a team focusing on various challenges related to quantum technologies. The team later graduated to [SandboxAQ](https://www.sandboxaq.com/).
  
  I contributed to the open source software [google/TensorNetwork](https://github.com/google/TensorNetwork) and performed simulations of quantum kernel methods for the classification of cosmology datasets, 
  a method that was later deployed on Google's Sycamore quantum computer and published in [npj Quantum Information journal](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-021-00498-9).
